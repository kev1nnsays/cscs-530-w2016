-Why Model, Epstein (2008) 
Everyone models implicitely.
Explicitely model to validate model or calibrate via data.
Explicit modeling allows others to replicate
Allows experts to contribute to model
Identify sensitive parameters

Reasons to model (other than predict)
1. Explain (very distinct from predict)
2. Guide data collection
3. Illuminate core dynamics
4. Suggest dynamical analogies
5. Discover new questions
6. Promote a scientific habit of mind
7. Bound (bracket) outcomes to plausible ranges
8. Illuminate core uncertainties.
9. Offer crisis options in near-real time
10. Demonstrate tradeoffs / suggest efficiencies
11. Challenge the robustness of prevailing theory through perturbations
12. Expose prevailing wisdom as incompatible with available data
13. Train practitioners
14. Discipline the policy dialogue
15. Educate the general public
16. Reveal the apparently simple (complex) to be complex (simple)

Models are analogies and simplifications that bring useful information to the top.

Monte Carlo method to discover value of pi (Buffon-Laplace)
Gosset's t-distribution
Computers built and simulation was applied to solve neutron diffusion problem which was analytically intractable
General Simulation Program to simulated industrial plant with state machines

Simulation Construction: Modular design, management of memory, control of error arising from discretization of cont. quantities,
design efficient time-advance mechanism, manage files
Strategic problem (Conway): 
-Start up problem: deciding when simulation is in SS. Solution: delete simulation generated obv. that are contaminated by init. bias
-Est. precision of estimators of SS-performance. Solution: batch means
-Performing precise comparisons of alt. system simulators:
